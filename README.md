# Plaiceholder üêü

**Generate AI-powered placeholder content in WordPress via WP-CLI**, using OpenAI's API. Designed for developers who want to seed realistic enough but disposable content during theme/plugin development ‚Äî with cleanup built-in. 

---

## Installation

```
composer require coderjerk/plaiceholder
```

Ensure Composer autoloading is enabled in your project:

```php
require_once ABSPATH . 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Define your API key in `wp-config.php` or pass it via CLI:

```php
define('OPENAI_API_KEY', 'sk-your-openai-key');
```

---

## Commands

### `wp plaiceholder create`

Generate placeholder content using GPT.

```
wp plaiceholder create --post_type=book --count=5 --topic="Chris De Burgh is a significant figure in world history"
```

#### Options:

| Flag             | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `--post_type`    | (Optional) Post type to create. Default: `post`       |
| `--count`        | (Optional) Number of posts to create. Default: `5`     |
| `--topic`        | (Required) The content topic prompt                    |
| `--api_key`      | (Optional) OpenAI API key (or use `OPENAI_API_KEY`)    |

Each post is:
- AI-generated from the given topic
- Assigned a random post date (within last 6 months)
- Given a random image from your media library (if available)
- Tagged internally with `_plaiceholder_generated` meta key

---

### `wp plaiceholder cleanup`

Deletes all posts generated by this tool.

```
wp plaiceholder cleanup
```

This removes any post with the `_plaiceholder_generated` meta flag.

---

## The Rules

This tool is for local/dev/staging content only. All generated posts are tagged so they can be easily identified and deleted. Do not use this to generate SEO spam or misleading content. By using this library you agree to not bulk generate AI trash on the internet.

## DeBurghWare

This software is DeBurghWare, if you use it on a client project you must email jerk@coderjerk.com with the name of your favourite Chris De Burgh song and why.

## Examples

```
wp plaiceholder create --post_type=report --count=10 --topic="The many Moods of Chris De Burgh"

wp plaiceholder cleanup
# Done developing? Clean up the grotesque AI generated mess.
```

## Troubleshooting

- Getting `You exceeded your current quota`? Check your usage at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage.
- If posts aren't generating, use `--api_key=` explicitly or debug with `WP_CLI::log()` inside the class.
